# Representations of medical images
Main repo for the project on content based image retrieval with beta variational encoder for chest X-ray exam. Project developed for the course "Interactive Machine Learning: Visualization & Explainability" in spring 2022 at ETHZ.


## Dataset
The dataset used is the [NIH chest Xrays](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC). Since the dataset is quite big, it is not placed in this repository and you should download it on [NIH's repo](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC) and then place it in a folder named "/data".
